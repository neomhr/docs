1. Hooks
    - It all starts with the hook. When we start working with a new customer, the director will ideate 10-15 initial hooks to get up to speed.
    - The director won’t always prepare these in advance. For instance, they might talk to the customer during the interview and ideate an interesting topic / hook on the spot.
    - Either way, they’ll add it to the Hook Ideation Tab in the content dashboard. This is where it all starts.
2. Fleshing out
    - This next stage happens during the weekly content interviews between the customer and the director.
    - Based on an ideated hook or another relevant content idea, the director will flesh out the post with the customer. This happens during the interview.
    - Fleshing out means asking follow-up questions, coming up with precise examples and analogies, etc…
    - The deliverable of the content interviews are 2-3 fully fleshed out LinkedIn posts.
    - The director will move a post from Hook Ideation to Fleshing out when they discuss / or have discussed it on a call, but it’s not in production yet.
3. Writing / Editing
    - After the posts have been fleshed out during the interview, we produce them internally. That means writing copy and (potentially) editing the video.
    - The director will assign the internal tasks here and we work on them. The post in the customer content dashboard will be set to the Status “Writing / Editing” so the
    customer is in the loop.
    - Once the internal production has been completed, the director moves the post to thenext stage and notifies the customer.
4. Make it your Own (Refinement)
    - Here, the customer can make changes to the copy and point out optimisations regarding the video.
